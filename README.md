# YOLO Object Detection Implementation in Tensorflow

This project implements the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm (Redmon et al., 2016) in TensorFlow, trained and evaluated on the PASCAL VOC dataset. While the implementation successfully reproduces the YOLO architecture and training pipeline, accuracy remains below state-of-the-art results. The repository demonstrates feasibility of a YOLO implementation in TensorFlow and serves as a starting point for further optimization in detection performance.
